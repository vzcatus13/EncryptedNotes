### Why?
Why it's here? There's a lot of note-taking apps!<br/>
First of all, it's my first app on Android ever. I was learning [the Android fundamentals course](https://google-developer-training.github.io/android-developer-fundamentals-course-concepts-v2/) by the Google Developers Training team, but just reading and doing small example apps was boring, so experimenting with the more complex app was more interesting.</br>
Secondly, I wanted to record my dreams. Also, I wanted that nobody can read them, except me. So I have two options: create a new alphabet or an Android app with encryption. I selected the last option. Before creating the app I found similar apps like [Safe Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protectedtext.android) (which is very good, but the design quite old) and [PotatoNotes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.potatoproject.notes) (which have good design, password protection, but the content is saved in plaintext).
